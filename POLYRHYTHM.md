To implement the POLYRHYTHM mode in your existing metronome project, we need to consider several aspects of the codebase and how they interact. Here's a detailed analysis and a master plan for implementing this new mode:

### 1. **Understanding the Current Codebase**

#### Key Components:
- **MetronomeState**: Manages the state of the metronome, including BPM, running state, and mode.
- **MetronomeChannel**: Represents each channel, handling beat patterns and lengths.
- **AudioController**: Manages audio output for beats.
- **Display**: Handles the visual representation of the metronome state.
- **EncoderController**: Manages user input through rotary encoders and buttons.
- **SolenoidController**: Controls solenoids for physical beat indication.

### 2. **Proposed Changes for POLYRHYTHM Mode**

#### Mode Switching:
- **MetronomeState**: Add a new mode enumeration for POLYRHYTHM. Implement logic to switch between POLYMETER and POLYRHYTHM modes.
- **Display**: Update the display to show the current mode using icons (circle for POLYMETER, crossed circle for POLYRHYTHM).

#### Channel Behavior:
- **MetronomeChannel**: 
  - In POLYRHYTHM mode, the first channel determines the loop length in beats.
  - The second channel subdivides this loop length into its number of equal steps.
  - Implement logic to calculate and update beat patterns based on the current mode.

#### Audio and Solenoid Output:
- **AudioController**: Adjust the audio output logic to handle the different beat patterns in POLYRHYTHM mode.
- **SolenoidController**: Ensure solenoids reflect the correct beat patterns for physical feedback.

#### User Input:
- **EncoderController**: Allow users to switch modes and adjust settings specific to POLYRHYTHM mode.

### 3. **Implementation Plan**

#### Step 1: Define Mode Enumeration
- Update `MetronomeState.h` to include a new enumeration for POLYRHYTHM.
- Modify `MetronomeState` to handle mode switching logic.

#### Step 2: Update Display
- Modify `Display.h` and `Display.cpp` to include icons for mode indication.
- Adjust the layout to accommodate the mode switch indicator.

#### Step 3: Modify Channel Logic
- Update `MetronomeChannel` to handle different logic for beat patterns in POLYRHYTHM mode.
- Implement methods to calculate subdivisions for the second channel based on the first channel's loop length.

#### Step 4: Adjust Audio and Solenoid Output
- Modify `AudioController` to generate audio patterns based on the current mode.
- Update `SolenoidController` to reflect the correct beat patterns.

#### Step 5: Update User Input Handling
- Modify `EncoderController` to allow mode switching and adjust settings specific to POLYRHYTHM mode.

#### Step 6: Testing and Debugging
- Thoroughly test the new mode to ensure correct behavior and synchronization between audio, solenoids, and display.
- Debug any issues related to timing, user input, or display updates.

### 4. **Considerations**

- **Synchronization**: Ensure that all components (audio, solenoids, display) are synchronized, especially when switching modes.
- **User Experience**: Make sure the mode switching is intuitive and the display clearly indicates the current mode.
- **Performance**: Test the performance to ensure the system can handle the additional complexity without lag or errors.

By following this plan, you can implement the POLYRHYTHM mode in a structured and efficient manner, ensuring that all components of the metronome work seamlessly together.
